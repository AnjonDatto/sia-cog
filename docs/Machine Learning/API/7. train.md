Tha training is applicable to deep learning model (model_type: mlp). The evaluate API call would trigger initial training using the pipeline parameters. But sometimes you would want to train for more iteration using the same model and saved weights. 

Invoke the API using: http://<host>:<port>/api/ml/train/<servicename>

Example:
```
http://localhost:5555/api/ml/train/housing
```

###Input Parameters:

* **epochs**: The number of epochs needs to train more (default: 32)
* **batch_size**: The current training batch size (default: 32)

This is a background process, so you can check the status by calling job status API.
