Welcome to the ml-api wiki! We are trying to provide an easy interface in form of web api to create machine learning without having knowledge of programmining language like python or R.

Components Involved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Python language (>2.7)
2) `Scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_
3) `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_
4) `MxNet <http://mxnet.io>`_


Please follow the `simple instruction <./install_configure.rst/>`_ on how to setup your own machine learning API to start creating and training models.
